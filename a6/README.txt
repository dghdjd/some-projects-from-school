Assignment 6: Shaders, Basic Ray Tracing

Overview:
This assignment demonstrates a basic ray tracing implementation using WebGL. The scene includes spheres with reflective surfaces and a movable light source, which interact to create realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections. The assignment also allows the user to move the light source using keyboard controls.

Features:
Ray tracing: Compute reflections and local shading for each surface.
Movable light source: Control the light source with W, A, S, D keys.
Shadows: Objects cast shadows based on the light sourceâ€™s position.
Recursive reflections: Supports 2 bounces for reflections.

Installation:
If you get a blank image, black floor, install a local http server to open the html,
i.e., see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server.
This can be launched from your directory by typing http-server in the terminal.
Then use http://localhost:8080 as your URL.
